A comprehensive log of my C++ learning progress, from fundamentals to advanced data structures and projects.
# 🚀 C++ Learning Journey | Digital Resume

Welcome to my C++ repository! This project serves as a live tracker of my journey from a beginner to an advanced C++ developer. I am currently building my foundation using the **College Wallah 12-Hour Masterclass**.

## 📌 Why this Repository?
I created this to:
* **Track Progress:** Document every concept I learn from the [Complete C++ One Shot Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7sAf4SbS_g).
* **Practice Logic:** Store code snippets for everything from basic patterns to complex Data Structures.
* **Showcase Skills:** Act as a digital resume for potential internships and roles.

## 💡 Key Learnings (Notes)
* **Variables [00:24:14]:** Learned that variables are like boxes; the data type defines what kind of "item" fits inside.
* **Floating Point [00:43:13]:** Realized how computer precision works differently for `int` vs `float`.
* **Logic:** Coding is 90% thinking and 10% typing!
